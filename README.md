--------------------------------------------------

**Implementation Specifications/Features:**
1. View Eclipse Events

Selecting this option allows a user to view all the events from a user provided text file. The program will present a neatly formatted display, showcasing the essential details such as the date, location, type, and significance for each eclipse event. This feature provides a quick snap of all the eclipse          events specified in the text file. It serves as a convenient way to stay updated on the current state of Eclipse History Encyclopedia.

2. Add New Eclipse Event

This option allows users to contribute to the Eclipse History Encyclopedia by adding a new eclipse event. Users will be prompted to enter details such as the date, location, type, and significance of the eclipse event they wish to add. Once the information is provided, the program will incorporate the new event into the encyclopedia. Users will receive a confirmation message signaling that the event has been successfully added.
   
3. Modify Eclipse Event

This option allows users to update or modify existing eclipse events in the Eclipse History Encyclopedia. Users can select an event they wish to modify from the list of available events and then update its details, such as the date, location, type, and/or significance. After making the necessary changes, users will receive a confirmation message indicating that the event has been successfully updated.
   
4. Search for Eclipse Events

This option allows users to search for eclipse events based on location, date or date range. Upon selecting this option, the program prompts the user to enter a location, date or date range to search for. Users can input either the full or partial name of the location or date they are interested in. The program then searches through the list of eclipse events and displays all events whose search query matches the input provided by the user. The search is case-insensitive and supports partial matches, allowing users to find events with incomplete location or date information. After displaying the matching events, the program returns to the main menu, allowing users to perform further actions.
   
5. Exit

Selecting this option allows users to exit the Eclipse History Encyclopedia program. When this option is chosen, the program displays a message indicating that the user is exiting the program. After displaying the exit message, the program terminates, and the user returns to the command line or terminal prompt. This option provides a convenient way for users to gracefully exit the program after they have completed their tasks or no longer wish to continue using it.
